      <p>
          In this post, I’ll show you that you don’t need to know everything to excel in business. I’ll explain the underlying principles of running a successful business. And that even if you manage to get an MBA, secure outside investor funding, and have a rock-star business plan, that doesn’t guarantee success. What will put the odds in your favor is learning the core principles of what makes a company successful. And to do this, you don’t need to spend $40,000 and 2-4 years of your life going to business school.

      <br>
      <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.7rem; -ms-flex-item-align: start;
      align-self: flex-start;">The Good Things About MBA Programs</h2>
      <p>
          Let me begin with the good things about MBA programs. If there is one advantage of going to business school, it’s that you get access to Fortune 500 recruiters,  consulting and accounting firms, and investment banks. This all happens with on-campus recruiting. But this advantage only provides you with a possible interview at these corporations, and does <b>NOT</b> guarantee you a job.  Not only that, but this advantage disappears within three years of graduating. At that point, employers don’t really care what you learned in school. They want to know what you’ve achieved since graduating.
      </p>

      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>What Is a Business?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        <span style="display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
            First I’m going to start by defining what a business is. <br />
            A business is a legal entity that:
        </span> <br />
        1. Creates value through products or services that people need or
        want <b>(value creation)</b><br />
        2. Attracts people to buy those products or services <b>(marketing)</b><br />
        3. Turns those people into customers <b>(sales)</b><br />
        4. Ensures those customers are satisfied with their purchase <b>(customer
            service)</b><br />
        5. Makes enough money to continue operating <b>(more money coming in than
            going out)</b>
      </p>

      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.7rem; -ms-flex-item-align: start;
      align-self: flex-start;">You Don’t Need to Know Everything, Just the Core Principles</h2>
      <p>
        “As to methods, there may be a million and then some, but principles are
        few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own
        methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have
        trouble.” –Ralph Waldo Emerson, Essayist and Poet
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        It’s impossible to learn everything there is to know about business.
        There are millions of books about business just in the United States
        alone. An estimated 11,000 new books in the business genre are published
        every year. Even if you read one book a day you wouldn’t even scratch
        the surface. That’s not even taking into account whether the book
        actually had useful content.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        You just need to learn the fundamentals. Everything else you would learn
        in an MBA program is noise. Follow the 80/20 principle made popular by
        Richard Koch in his book
        <a style="color:rgb(9, 185, 255);" href="https://amzn.to/2NfH9zO"
          >The 80/20 Principle: The Secret to Achieving More with Less</a
        >. By focusing on the important 20% and ignoring the unneeded 80%, you
        will learn how to start or improve a business, and handle even the most
        difficult business problems you come up against. While your peers spend
        years in school learning about business in the hope of a successful
        career and spending $40,000 to do it, you will have gained 2-4 years of
        experience running a business. This gives you a huge advantage in
        business and in life. Not to mention you can use that money you would
        have spent on tuition to fund your startup. And this is why I recommend
        that anyone who wants a career in business start a small company to
        learn first hand how it works.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Even if you decide to take an MBA program, you can run a small business
        on the side to out-compete your peers. It doesn’t matter what kind of
        business you start. It could be a small affiliate website that requires
        only 4 hours a week. Or a larger business, such as an e-commerce shop
        with employees and warehouse space. I plan on making a future post about
        starting an e-commerce shop, which explains the fundamentals of what you
        need to get started and make a profit.
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.7rem; -ms-flex-item-align: start;
      align-self: flex-start;">
        Understanding Business Is More Important Than Having a Business Plan
      </h2>

      <p>
        “Many who are self-taught far excel the doctors, masters, and bachelors
        of the most renowned universities.” –Ludwig Von Mises, Austrian
        Economist and Author of
        <a style="color:rgb(9, 185, 255);" href="https://amzn.to/2BO4sLF"
          >Human Action</a
        >
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        You can have the best business plan in the world and still fail. No
        matter what you do in life there is going to be unexpected obstacles
        that get in your way. This reality gave birth to the expression, “expect
        the unexpected”. By gaining an understanding of business you soften the
        blow of obstacles, and allow your business to adapt and grow while other
        companies file for bankruptcy.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        It reminds me of traditional martial arts. Every year thousands of
        karate students are taught a punching technique known as Tsuki-waza.
        You’ve probably seen it before, if you’re every watched the popular
        <a style="color:rgb(9, 185, 255);" href="https://amzn.to/2MRRJhh"
          >Karate Kid</a
        >
        movies. Daniel punches with one fist while bringing the other down to
        his hip. Then he does it again, but with the other arm. And if you’ve
        ever seen a UFC match, or a street fight, you will never see this punch
        actually used, even by karate practitioners. Why is this? Ramsey Dewey,
        a martial artist of 20 years who now teaches combat sports in Shanghai
        China, says “people have forgotten the original meaning behind the
        punch. Why do we pull one arm down to our hip? Because it’s an armbar.”
        The armbar is one of the joint locks used in mixed martial arts
        competition and submission wrestling tournaments which allows you to
        break your opponent’s arm if you put enough pressure on it.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Most modern karate student’s practice this punch without ever
        understanding it’s original purpose. If they happen to ever end up in an
        unfortunate situation where they need to defend themselves, the
        tsuki-waza karate plan will fail them.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        The same can be said about relying on a business plan instead of
        understanding the underlying meaning behind the strategies.
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.7rem; -ms-flex-item-align: start;
      align-self: flex-start;">Raising Money Does Not Guarantee Success</h2>

      <p>
        Russell Brunson, the founder of
        <a
          style="color:rgb(9, 185, 255);"
          href="https://clickfunnels.com?cf_affiliate_id=2023687&affiliate_id=2023687&aff_sub=bargund&aff_sub2=&nopopup=false&noautoplay=false&cookiepreview=false"
          >ClickFunnels</a
        >, started his business with no outside funding. It was just him, his
        co-founder Todd Dickerson, and a handful of software engineers. His two
        competitors at the time had $90 million and $140 million in Venture
        Capital funds. But because Russell understood the fundamentals of what
        makes a business successful, he grew his company into a $100 million
        machine in only three years, making it the fastest growing, non-VC
        funded tech startup in the world. His competitors went bankrupt. I plan
        on making future posts about ClickFunnels and how they could double your
        revenue within a year–and that’s a modest estimate.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        The Wright brothers had no funding but they had a gift for understanding
        systems. Build something basic and cheap that works, and make small
        improvements. Test it in the field, and then make more tweaks. This is a
        fundamental principle of business called the Minimum Viable Product. It
        was this timeless strategy that allowed them to achieve what their
        heavily funded competitors could not. Like the Greek God Prometheus who
        gave fire to humanity, the Wright brothers forever changed the world by
        giving flight to the people.

        of outside funding. Now they make $600 million a year, as of 2019. And
        they plan on hitting $700 million by 2020. MailChimp started as a paid
        service, but began offering a free plan in 2009. With that change in
        strategy they went from 85,000 users to 450,000 in less than a year. All
        while better funded tech companies were losing money and customers.

        Now it’s time to explain the principles needed to operate a successful
        business. Keep in mind that there is no way I can cram all the fine
        details into one article, but I plan on making a separate post for each
        one to explain them better:
      </p>
      <br />

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b
              >Create value through products or services that people want or
              need:</b
            >
            <br />
            In this phase you need to do market research. Does your business
            idea benefit other people in some way? Is there a large group of
            people who want or need what you’re offering? A simple way to figure
            this out is to use
            <b>Clayton Alderfer’s Hierarchy of Needs.</b> This is a concept he
            created called ERG theory. It explains that people pursue three
            stages of needs:<br /><br />

            <ul>
              <li>Existence (food, water, shelter)</li>
              <li>Relatedness (friends, & finding a spouse)</li>
              <li>Growth (hobbies & gaining new skills)</li>
            </ul>

            <span style="display: inline-block; margin-top: 0.7rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
                I’ll give some examples of each one so you have an idea of weather
                your business has a chance.
            </span>
            <br />

            <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Existence:</b> restaurants, real estate investing, beverages,
                  snacks, farming, et cetera.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Relatedness:</b> dating websites, beauty products, social media
                  apps, forums, blogs, et cetera.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Growth:</b> fishing, woodworking, any kind of workshop, online
                    courses, et cetera.
                </li>
              </ul>
          </p>
        </li>
        <br />

        <li>

            If no one knows your business exists, then it can’t survive. You
            need to write down who your primary customer is. And then figure out
            where they hang out. Once you do that, you need to put valuable
            information in front of their faces. An important point to keep in
            mind, is to not be annoying and spamy. Generally you want to provide
            value through your content 80% of the time, and only market to them
            for the remaining 20%. Some techniques you could use are:<br />
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                Facebook groups
              </li>
              <li>
                Forums that are about your target genre (ex: fishing forums).
              </li>
              <li>
                Twitter. Utilize the hashtag to find people interested in your
                  genre.
                </li>
              <li>
                Paid advertising on social media like Facebook and Instagram.
              </li>
              <li>
                Create a blog with useful content. Then collect emails. This way
                  you have an audience you know are interested in your genre.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Write guest posts on other people's blog.
              </li>

                  Strengthen the SEO (Search Engine Optimization) of your blog
                  posts.<br />
                  This will allow people to naturally find your website on google
                  while searching for something. Most of your SEO will come from your
                  company’s blog. This is a good reason why every small business
                  should have a blog. I recommend
                  <a style="color:rgb(9, 185, 255);" href="http://wordpress.org"
                    >Wordpress</a

                  that not everything on Wordpress is free. Developers and designers
                  create optional themes and plugins that make your website more
                  amazing. But you can find plenty of free themes and plugins that
                  look good and perform great. And if you need someone to set it up, or have a more custom idea in mind, you’ll have to hire a developer. Wordpress is just the software, you

                  physical one. A domain is the unique address or name in the URL that
                  points people to your website. For example, facebook.com is a domain
                  address for the corporation known as Facebook.

            <b>Turn those people into customers (sales):</b><br />
            To excel as a business you must earn the trust of your customers.
            Your company cannot survive without people who actually pay you for
            your product or service. That’s what makes sales different from
            marketing. When you market to people, you’re getting them to come
            see your offer. But once they arrive, you must help them understand
            the importance that your product would have on their lives. It’s an
            equally beneficial transaction. And that’s how the best business’s
            operate. The best way to turn visitors into customers is to build
            trust with them.<br />
            Some things you can do to build trust:<br /><br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                  <a style="color:rgb(9, 185, 255);" href="http://bbb.org"
              ><b>BBB (Better Business Bureau)</b></a
            ><b>:</b>
                  If your business in based in the United States, you can sign-up with
                  the Better Business Bureau which gives you instant credibility with
                  your customers.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Use <b>Credit and Background Check</b> Services.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Offer <b>Escrow Accounts</b>. This is where a trusted third-party
                  holds the money until the service is provided.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Create a <b>Video</b> for your website that shows your face. If
                  you don’t want to show your own face, you can select a
                  representative from among your employees.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Put <b>Photos and Bios</b> of your staff on the company About
                  page.
              </li>
              <li>
                  <b>Testimonials</b> from past clients. Video testimonials are
                  especially strong.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Get <b>Word-of-Mouth</b> referrals by having good customer
                  service. And make sure you ask your customers and clients for
                  referals. Don't expect them to do it themselves.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Get an <b>Authority Figure</b>, like a micro-influencer, to say good
                  things about your company. It builds social credibility. I’ll cover
                  this more in-depth in another post. And by the way, a <b>micro-influencer</b> is someone with 1,000+ followers on social media. Once they hit 1 million+ followers, they're considered fully fledged <b>Influencers.</b> Recent research shows that micro-influencers are trusted more by their audience, and so an endorsement from them goes a long way for a small business.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <b>Pricing:</b><br />
            When given the option, people will choose to pay as little as
            possible for a product. There are some exception to this rule, but
            they’re beyond the scope of this post. This means that whatever
            price you charge for your services, you <b>must</b> convince the
            customer that what you’re selling is worth the price your charging.

              >Ensure those customers are satisfied with their purchase
              (customer service):</b
            ><br />
            This phase involves things like:<br />
            <ol>
              <li>
                  Making sure the product gets to the customer as fast as possible
                  and without damage.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Customer Service: If the product is damaged upon arrival, make is
                  as easy as possible for them to return it.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Make sure your product or service meets or exceeds the
                  expectations of your customers. Be clear about what they will get.
                  It’s better for them to receive more than what they thought they
                  would, rather than less.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <b
              >Make enough money to continue operating (more money coming in
              than going out):</b
            ><br />
            You must make enough money to continue operating, otherwise your
            company will end. Generating money is the difference between a
            business and a hobby. In terms of business finances, you don’t need
            to know more than the basics unless you plan on becoming a
            professional accountant or CPA. The formula is simple: make more
            money than your company spends. When your company makes money, it’s
            called <b>revenue</b>. And when you pay your employees a salary, or
            order more inventory, those are called <b>expenses</b>. <br /><br />
            Your goal is to maximize revenue and minimize expenses.
            <b>Profit</b> is what you get when you subtract your expenses from
            your revenue. For example, if your company makes $100,000 for the
            year. That’s your revenue. And you pay yourself a salary of $50,000.
            Plus, you spend $20,000 on inventory. The calculation looks like
            this:
            <br />
            <span
              style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; margin-top: 0.5rem; display: inline-block; padding-left: 2rem;"
              >$100,000 - $70,000 = <b>$30,000 Profit</b></span
            >
            <br />
            I'm not an attorney, so you would need to check your local tax laws
            and consult with an actual attorney. But in the United States, you
            only pay taxes on your profits. In this example, you would pay tax
            on $30,000. Let’s assume your tax rate is 24%. The calculation would
            look like this:
            <br />

            <span
              style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; margin-top: 0.5rem; display: inline-block; padding-left: 2rem;"
              >$30,000 * 24% = <b>$7,200 paid in taxes</b></span
            >
            <br />
            You are left with $22,800 in profit. Some of that profit will need
            to be reinvested back into your business. What I mean by
            <b>reinvest</b> is to spend some of your profit on things that
            improve your company's ability to make more money. For example,
            hiring an expert to make an intro video for your website's homepage.
            Or increasing your marketing budget, which would get you more
            customers than the year before. These are what I call
            <b>improvement projects.</b> Every year you fund these improvement
            projects, you increase your revenue. Three years later you could
            have gone from making $100,000 a year, to $1 million. Keep in mind
            that not all improvement projects are equal. Some will make you more
            money than others.
