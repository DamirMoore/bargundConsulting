            practices of Bargund Consulting. (Bargund Consulting”, “we”, “us”, “our”) on our websites located at the
            domains bargundconsulting.com, as well as such other websites or mobile applications that we own or operate
            (individually and collectively, “Our Website” or the Bargund Consulting Website”). Contact us if you

            <h3><strong>What information do We collect?</strong></h3>

            <p>We collect information from you when you visit our website. When submitting or registering on our
                website, you may
                be asked to enter your: name, e-mail address, and other personal information. You may, however, visit
                our website anonymously.

                <br>
                <strong>Device Information from Bargund Consulting Visitors</strong>
                <br>
                We may receive and collect certain Information furnished by
                the visitor's browser or otherwise by their access device (“Device Information”), such as:
                <br>
                1. Browser Information
                <br>
                2. Operating System Information
                <br>
                3. Mobile Device Information (e.g., device identifier, mobile operating system, etc.)
                <br>
                4. IP address (stored in anonymized form)
                <br>
                5. Page Accessed
                <br>
                6. Geographic Location
                <br>
                7. Time of visit (by day, week, and duration)
                <br>
                8. Whether the visitor is a new or return visitor
                <br>
                Other such Information as may be delivered or shared by the applicable browser or access software or
                device.

                <br><br>
                <strong>Referral Information</strong>
                <br>
                We may also receive certain information regarding visitors from the prior website
                visited by such visitors (“Referral Information”). For instance, If a Bargund Consulting Visitor navigates
                to the
                Bargund Consulting Website from another website, Bargund Consulting may receive certain information from the
                referring
                website (i.e., the last website the visitor visited before visiting the Bargund Consulting Website) as
                part of
                the Hypertext Transfer Protocol ("HTTP") request. For example, if a Bargund Consulting Visitor navigates
                to the
                Bargund Consulting Website from a search engine, Bargund Consulting may receive information contained in the
                referring URL
                for the applicable search query, such as the terms the Bargund Consulting Visitor was searching for before
                visiting the Bargund Consulting Website.
            </p>

            <h3><strong>What do We use your information for?</strong></h3>

            <p>Any of the information We collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>To improve our website</li>

                <li>To improve customer service</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><strong>How do we protect your information?</strong></h3>

            <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you
                place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. One of the ways we do this is
                through SSL encryption--the lock in the upper left-hand side of the URL--to secure any data that passes

            <h3><strong>Cookies</strong></h3>

                your browser and capture and remember certain information.</p>

            <p>
                We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits.
                As described in our Cookie Policy, the Service may utilize first-party cookies (small text files that
                Bargund Consulting stores locally on a Client Site Visitor’s device) on Client Sites for one or more of
                the
                following purposes: to help identify whether a Client Site Visitor is a first time visitor, or has
                visited previously (provided that we will not store identifiers that can be used to personally identify
                such Client Site Visitors); assess usage patterns and perform traffic analysis; identify preferences;
                diagnose problems with our Service; analyze trends; and otherwise administer Bargund Consulting products
                and
                services. Cookies placed by Bargund Consulting on the computers of Client Site Visitors do not include

                Consulting link cookies to such Personally Identifiable Information on our servers or databases.

            <h3><strong>Transfer of Data Abroad/International Users.</strong></h3>
            <p>
                If you are visiting the Our Website or a Client Site from a country other than the United States of
                America the various communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across
                international boundaries. By visiting the Our Website or the Client Site, as applicable, you consent to
                the processing and transfer of your data as set out in this Privacy Policy. By using the Our Website or

                information in and to the United States, or other countries and territories, pursuant to the laws of the
                United States.

                If we transfer Personally Identifying Information from a Client Site in the European Economic Area
                (“EEA”) to other countries not deemed adequate under applicable data protection law, we will do so in
                compliance with either:

            </p>

            <h3><strong>Bargund Consulting Does Not Collect Visitor Information Across Multiple Sites</strong></h3>
            <p>
                Bargund Consulting does not collect or aggregate information about visitor behavior on multiple, different
                websites.
            </p>

            <h3><strong>Bargund Consulting Disclaimers Regarding Personally Identifying Information of Client Site
                    Visitors</strong></h3>
            <p>
                Bargund Consulting's Service is not designed to knowingly collect or extract from Client Visitor
                Information (including any Recorded Interactions or Device Information received from Client Sites
                through the Service) information that could be used to personally identify Client Site Visitors, such as
                a Client Site Visitor’s name, address or phone number ("Personally Identifiable Information") when a
                Client Site Visitor visits a Client Site that uses the Bargund Consulting Service. In particular, Bargund
                Consulting does not attempt to identify, decipher, access, or associate Personally Identifying
                Information regarding a Client Site Visitor from any Recorded Interactions or Device Information,
                provided that Bargund Consulting may receive Referral Information.
            </p>

            <h3><strong>Policy Concerning Children Under Age of 16</strong></h3>
            <p>

                children
                under 16. If we learn that we have Personally Identifiable Information of a child under age 16, we will
                remove it. If you believe we have Personally Identifiable Information about a child under the age of 16,
                please notify us.
